## Future Concerns
3/26
I just noticed based on the instructions that it probably wants the architecture in app or whatever the final form, however pulling it into Android Studio and building the module does not worked as I intend it to, and there are very few resources that I've found for converting a non published android app product into an android app product. I plan to come to consulting to resolve this, but I wanted to clarify that the structure will be as I have planned it out with the hierarchy it is just in standard. Apologies if that was what was intended.
