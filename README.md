# Roomy

## What is this project?
This is a project made during Daniel Lee's progression through the CSCI425 class at the College of William & Mary in 2023.

This is a fully functional Android App that can be used on any Android device, such as smartphones or tablets.

The project is fully coded and created by Daniel Lee.

## Description
Roomy is a Household Management Tool used to organize the responsibilities of co-living with one or more roommates. 

## Installation
With its current iteration, Roomy can be easily be easily cloned using the https clone link and a personal access token into any ide. Running the architecture as is should print hello world. The structure is identical to the finish product but please take a look at the following

## Future Concerns
3/26/23
I just noticed based on the instructions that it probably wants the architecture in app or whatever the final form, however pulling it into Android Studio and building the module does not worked as I intend it to, and there are very few resources that I've found for converting a non published android app product into an android app product. I plan to come to consulting to resolve this, but I wanted to clarify that the structure will be as I have planned it out with the hierarchy it is just in standard. Apologies if that was what was intended.
