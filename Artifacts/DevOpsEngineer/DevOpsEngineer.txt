General Info for DevOps Engineer

Description : keeps track on what relates to the Agile SW Dev,
needed technology (IDE, Gitlab repository, software stack, programming language, sw dev
tools and libraries), helps and resolve issues with the CI/CD pipeline, Docker, Kubernetes
and alike. We need team members being productively contribute to the code base, the code
needs to be build into executables that run on some architecture such that one can demo
the prototype to interested stakeholders. Just for clarification: an Android app that only runs
locally on your laptop inside an emulator with just some UI screens is NOT a sufficient
prototype. For persistent storage you typically need something on the backend that is
shared across users.
