General Info for CEO

Description : Your startup needs a vision, a competitive advantage,
something you do better than anyone else. This requires research work, conceptual designs.
Someone needs to act as the founder(s) or CEO, the ones who make the decision in case
the team does not naturally agree on an issue and a decision is necessary to avoid being
stuck. “The buck stops here”. (Note: being unable to make decisions in a timely manner is
deadly for a startup and many early on decisions are do or die decisions). And you need
someone who is ready to present and pitch your startup to customers, venture capitalists,
possible employees. A startup burns through funding till it becomes profitable, so a CEO
needs to work on securing funding, for instance with an SBIR proposal (together with the
business analyst).
